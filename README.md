# Predict-Movie-Revenue-with-Linear-Regression
Predicting movie box office revenue using linear regression

Initially, we start with cleaning the cost_revenue_dirty.csv and eliminate the rows having $0 of worldwide revenue.
We only need 2 columns which are Production_Budget and Worldwide_Gross.

We form a clean csv file with only those 2 columns.
